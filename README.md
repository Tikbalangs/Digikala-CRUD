# Digikala-CRUD
## Overview
Developed a fully responsive and fully functional CRUD React application inspired by Digikala home page, using TailwindCSS, react-router-dom, UseState and UseEffects hooks, etc.
**This project is in Persian Language**

## Installation
To run the project, follow these instructiions:
1) Run the json database file.
   ```bash
   json-server db.json
   ```
   
   **Note**: If you don't have json-server installed, first install it.
      ```bash
      npm install json-server
      ```

2) It's a vite project so run the project.
   ```bash
   npm run dev

3) Login (ورود | ثبت نام) as either a user, or admin.


| Username | Password |
|-----|-----------|
|     admin| adminpass|
|     ala| alapass|

Note that "Admin" has access to change the database while managing data, and the user "ala" doesn't. (kind of ironic since I'm the creator, isn't it?)

Enjoy!
